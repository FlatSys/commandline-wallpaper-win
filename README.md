# Windows Command Line Wallpaper Selector
A command line alternative to replacing a windows wallpaper, for machines with limited access to system settings, or any other relevant reason. This was originally set as a challenge by my high school computing teacher to see if I was able to overwrite the desktop wallpaper set by the school for the current user. It worked!
